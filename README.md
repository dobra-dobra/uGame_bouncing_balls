# Bouncing balls for uGame 10
6 balls bouncing on the screen of the [uGame 10 console](https://www.tindie.com/products/deshipu/ugame-10-python-game-console-kit/ "Tindie link"). Detail about console can be found on it's [Hackaday.io page](https://hackaday.io/project/27629-game "Hackaday.io").

For optimal speed run it on CircuitPython 4.1 or newer.

## Resources
Work was based on uGame 10 tutorial available [here](https://ugame.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html "Read the Docs link"). Single note bounce sound was exported from [Pico-8 editor](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php "Pico-8"), which is an overkill, but it was the tool which I had at hand.
